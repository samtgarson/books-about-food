      Fill as much of the information as you can. We hope the wider community

      If you are logged in, you can save your progress and come back to it
      later. Only upload good quality flat images of the cover and spreads—not
      photographs of them. The more detail you add the better it represents the
      book and the people involved in creating it. We will manually check and
      publish every submission. Thank you for considering to submit a cookbook.
      The beauty of this platform relies on the community submitting cookbooks
      they’ve been a part of.
